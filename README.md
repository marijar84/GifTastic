The most important thing of this application is to use an API to obtain information.

This application obtains the gifs of Cartoons, the first image obtained is the movie associated with the searched word, the rest of the 
images are the gifs that change when the user clicks on the image.

To make this game use GIPHY API, javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, html

### Instructions

- Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

- When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

- Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
